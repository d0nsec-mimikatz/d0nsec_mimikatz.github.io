Welcome to my first blog post! 

This site is powered by **Jekyll** and the **Minimal Mistakes** theme, dark because you are crazy if you use any other theme. Here's what I’ve done so far:

- Set up a GitHub Pages site with Minimal Mistakes.
- Added a background and readable text colors.
- Configured the site to document my programming projects, experiments, and ideas.

### What’s next?

I plan to:

1. Add project pages with screenshots and descriptions.
2. Write tutorials on Python scripts I’m experimenting with.
3. Share tips on using Jekyll and GitHub Pages efficiently.

Stay tuned for more updates!
